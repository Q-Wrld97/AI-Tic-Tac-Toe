    Description: Met and discussed project specifications and deliverables and initial Implementation.
    
     Details: The initial implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game was completed. The game board was represented using a simple 2D list. Basic functionalities such as displaying the board, getting user input, and checking for a winner were implemented. At this stage, the game was limited to player vs player mode, and no AI players were involved in the gameplay. The initial implementation was propose by Mahmood Sakib and implemented out by Quang Le.

    Description: Changes to the Implementation and GitHub Repository made

    Details: The implementation of the game board representation was changed from a 2D list to a dictionary. This change was proposed by Adam Clark and implemented by Quang Le with the assistance of Mahmood Sakib. The use of a dictionary simplified the access to board positions and improved the efficiency of the code. This modification enhanced the implementation and paved the way for future enhancements, such as the addition of AI players. We also added a random AI player for comparison. The random AI player was implemented by Quang Le and tested by Adam Clark and Mahmood Sakib by playing against the AI and verifying that the AI makes random moves. We also created the game play loop of asking user if they want to play again. This was implemented by Adam Clark and tested by Quang Le and Mahmood Sakib by playing the game and checking if the game ask the user if they want to play again and also resetting the game board by clearing out all dictionary value.
